# Power BI Dashboards for Sales Performance

Power BI dashboards can be a helpful tool to provide insights into sales performance and trends of an organization.  
The dashboard should include key metrics such as total sales, sales by product, sales by location, sales by customer segment, and sales by product category.  
It should also provide comparisons of performance to prior years and allow for drill-down into individual markets and products.
