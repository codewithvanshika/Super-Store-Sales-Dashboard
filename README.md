## Delays and Time Analysis

The **Delays and Time Analysis** page dives deeper into flight delays and their impact on airport operations. This section includes:

- **Delay Trends**: Visualizations showing the trend of delays over time (daily, weekly, monthly).
- **Delay Causes**: Analysis of the primary causes of delays (e.g., weather, technical issues, air traffic control).
- **Peak Delay Times**: Identification of times of day and days of the week with the highest delays.
- **Delay Distribution**: Distribution of delays by duration (e.g., 0-15 minutes, 16-30 minutes, etc.).

This analysis helps identify patterns and potential areas for operational improvements.
